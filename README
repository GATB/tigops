# Tigops 

Manipulation of unitigs and contigs. Relatively old code from 2014 but might still be useful for some tasks today:

 - compute coverage from a dataset of reads

 - some other hidden features in the source code

# Project build

For building your project, you should do the following
    
    cd tools/tigops
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j 8

    
Then, you should get a binary holding the name of the project.

Note: the first compilation should take some time since the GATB-CORE library is generated.


Computing coverage for shorter kmers than unitig length
----

Tigops considers only kmers that are unique to the unitig.
